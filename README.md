## Intruduction

The project started in August 2018. This set of CFG presets covers almost all application scenarios, with detailed notes:

| scenes to be used          | File Name              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| Game Settings          | `auto.cfg`        |
| Crosshair parameters (using jump throw)    | `crosshair.cfg`   |
| Practice Settings          | `practice.cfg`    |
| Solo        | `solo.cfg`        |
| Demos        | `demo.cfg`        |

All parameters have been tested in detail, and the key positions have been carefully considered to ensure that the keys for each function are in the most comfortable position for use. It is suitable for players who are not familiar with CS2 instructions and want to use them immediately to save time, or players who want to refer to other people's codes to enrich their own CFG.

After downloading this set of presets, according to the instructions for use, back up the settings, simply modify the parameters, put it in the correct location, and set the startup items to enjoy the convenience brought by the presets. Generally, the entire process does not exceed 30 minutes.
